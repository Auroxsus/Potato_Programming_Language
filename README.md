# Potato_Programming_Language
Ultimatly, there are only slight changes made from the reader to scanner and scanner to parser. Parser to compilier will start off with _light_ changes as well but I hope it will spiral into a complex compiler that will be able to translate the entire POTATO language, or at least as much as I can develop.

As I am continously improving and adding new features, it will be updated in the compiler code. There are no plans to create a sperate updated PotatoXScanner.cpp, PotatoXParcer.cpp, PotatoXCompilier.cpp. The previous versions and executable files will stay in the repository and in the "Previous_Versions" folder for historical purposes. 

These are for **MY** understanding of how my compilier works but to get a 'deeper look' into the logic of each, feel free to browse the attached wiki where I attempt to explain additions and new functions introduced in the source code. 

## File Decriptions
**Potato.h** is the core of our project, the **reader-and-lister** classes and grows along with the compilier.

**PotatoCompiler.cpp** is the source file of our project and is updated as additional features and functions are added to the POTATO programming language.

**PotatoCompilier.exe** is the current version of the official "compilier" for the POTATO programming language. It is a combination of PotatoComplier.cpp + Potato.h
